# Data Directory

This directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the QCNN models.

## Structure

```
data/
├── raw/                    # Raw datasets (not included in git due to size)
│   ├── mnist/             # MNIST dataset files
│   └── fashion_mnist/     # Fashion-MNIST dataset files (large files excluded)
└── processed/             # Preprocessed data (generated by scripts/preprocess.py)
    └── mnist/
        ├── amplitude/     # Amplitude encoded data
        └── angle/         # Angle encoded data
```

## Getting the Data

### Automatic Download (Recommended)

The project includes automatic data downloading functionality:

```bash
# This will automatically download MNIST data
python scripts/preprocess.py --dataset mnist --encoding amplitude
```

### Manual Download

If you need Fashion-MNIST data:

1. Visit [Fashion-MNIST GitHub repository](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
2. Download the CSV files:
   - `fashion-mnist_train.csv` (~127MB)
   - `fashion-mnist_test.csv` (~21MB)
3. Place them in `data/raw/fashion_mnist/`

### Note on Large Files

Due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit, large dataset files are excluded from version control. The preprocessing scripts will handle data downloading automatically when needed.
